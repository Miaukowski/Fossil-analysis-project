# Fossil-analysis-project


In this assignment, I utilized data from the NOW (New and Old Worlds) fossil mammal database to investigate patterns of speciation over time and space. My focus was on discerning when and where speciation rates had been notably high. The task involved identifying time periods and locations in the history of mammals that were giving rise to exceptionally high numbers of new species, commonly known as the "species factory" in evolutionary literature. I was interested in understanding why and in what ways those times and places were considered special. The role of computational science was for me to recognize and characterize such times and places. The project had 10 excerises to be completed conserning analysis.
